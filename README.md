## Bio
Hello, my name is Paulina. I am 19 years old, and I am a student at Florida Atlantic University pursuing a dual degree in computer engineering and computer science. I am also pursuing a certificate in data science, and I am taking graduate courses towards the Joint BS/MS program at FAU.

I expect to probably continue my education and pursue a master's degree in computer science after I graduate with my two bachelor's degrees. I plan to graduate by the end of Fall 2023. 

Thank you for taking the time to view my GitHub page.
